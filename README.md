# CS280p2 Peer and Tracker packet transfer

This project consists of two files; tracker.py and peer.py. This code was designed by Caleb Sacks, Ezekiel Palmer, Grant Meyer, and Jonathan Hoff for CSCI 280 at Clark University as a part of our Programming Assignment 2. The python files in this repository are my own personal copies of the original code we worked on.

# Tracker

The tracker breaks up a specified file into chunks of size 10KB each. It then randomly distributes the chunks to each of the running peers when the peers connect to the tracker. The tracker must send each chunk but cannot send the same chunk more than once, and sends the same number of chunks to each peer randomly.

# Peer

Each person runs the peer on their own device. They connect the peer to the tracker and recieve random chunks from a specified file. After every peer has recieved their chunks, the peers then connect to their "neighbors." By connecting each peer, each peer then has an upload neighbor and a download neighbor to send chunks to one and recieve chunks from the other. The peers send all the individual chunks between themselves until each peer has all the chunks of the file. Then the peers reassemble the file.
